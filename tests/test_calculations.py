    Test calculation operations with various scenarios.
    
    This test ensures that the Calculation class correctly performs the arithmetic operation
    (specified by the 'operation' parameter) on two Decimal operands ('a' and 'b'),
    and that the result matches the expected outcome.
    
    Parameters:
        a (Decimal): The first operand in the calculation.
        b (Decimal): The second operand in the calculation.
        operation (function): The arithmetic operation to perform.
        expected (Decimal): The expected result of the operation.

    Test the string representation (__repr__) of the Calculation class.
